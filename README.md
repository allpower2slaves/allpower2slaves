# Hello world

My personal GitHub Page.

I use Fedora Workstation (the one with GNOME) on my desktop systems and try to
configure everything with Ansible. Sometimes I convert stuff into RPM packages
with Fedora Copr and write shell scripts that make my life a bit easier.

I use Neovim for everything -- notetaking, editing code and even splitting terminal windows.
